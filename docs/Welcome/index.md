# Rankify Basics

## Project Overview

This project is implementation of the "Continuous Voting" protocol. Participants engage over extended periods in a series of rounds and instances, aiming to create a ladder where winners are selected based on their ability to propose ideas that their group accepts through blind voting. The goal is to develop a system that can be played indefinitely, fostering continuous engagement and idea generation.
