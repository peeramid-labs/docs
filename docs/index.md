# Getting started

## Project Overview


You are visiting Peeramid Labs documentation portal. This portal is designed to help you get started with meritocratic autonomous organizations (MAOs) and its components.

## What is a MAO?

Meritocratic Autonomous Organizations (MAOs) are a new form of decentralized organization that is designed to be more efficient, transparent, and fair than traditional organizations. MAOs are built on blockchain technology, which allows them to operate without a central authority, similarly to [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization). However, MAOs are different from DAOs in that they are designed to be meritocratic, meaning that decisions are made based on the merit of the participants rather than on their pure wealth or power within the organization.


### Measuring competences

Autonomously measuring merit is a complex task, and it is done trough a [Autonomous Competence Identification Protocol](https://www.rankify.it/papers/).

In a nutshell, it is a continuous process of proposing and voting in semi-anonymous way which allows to measure the competence of the participants relative to their group corresponding intention.
By adding a participation time constant, participation cost and a tokenized ranking ladder, it is possible to create a system that will _lift_ the most competent participants to the top of the ladder while exponentially more complex for a sybil group to attack the system.
