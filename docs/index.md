# Getting started

## Project Overview

Rankify is a pioneering platform designed to transform organizational management through decentralized decision-making structures and AI-enhanced collaboration. By implementing the innovative [Autonomous Competence Identification (ACID) protocol](https://www.rankify.it/research/paper/) protocol, Rankify empowers organizations to streamline decision processes, improve accuracy, and achieve outcomes that rival those of expert systems.

The success of this innovative approach hinges on the effective implementation of the ACID protocol, a milestone that promises to revolutionize the way organizations operate.

## Goals

Project goal is to create a fully autonomous on-chain system that is efficient and secure in it's decision making process. Ultimate goal is to create a organization management protocol that is neural-network like, fully decentralized and is represented by as diverse as possible, top level experts in their respective fields.

## Scope

The project is divided into several phases, each of which is designed to address a specific aspect of the ACID protocol. The first phase focuses on the development of the core infrastructure, including the creation of the Rankify DAO, the implementation of the ACID protocol, and the establishment of the Rankify ecosystem.

Subsequent phases will focus on the development of additional features, such as the integration of AI-enhanced decision-making tools, the creation of a decentralized marketplace, and the implementation of MPC (Multi-Party Computation) based privacy solutions.

Project ecosystem is EVM supported chains in the initial stages, with plans to expand to other chains in the future as well as support private chains that will be able to roll-up to public chains.
